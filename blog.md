SANTA MONICA PIER:
This is my favorite place in California. I love the enthusiasm and briskness around here. I have been there four times and still, it is not enough. It's not about the beaches (I mean come on, I am from the campus which has its own beach). Every time this place has some surprise planted for me. From an excellent musical show to incredible magic play and from city contour during sunrise to sun dropping in the sea, this place is a stretch of beauty. I saw a sea lion on my recent visit!

DEATH VALLEY TRIP:
If you love impeccable white snow but hate the cold!!!
Don't be panicked by the title, you will be fine.
Badwater basin (not at all bad) is almost 300 ft below the sea level. Do check out the sea level sign in the nearby mountain. The place was surprisingly beautiful. Besieged by the vast landscape of white salt crust and bounded by the far reached mountains, I was feeling heavenly. Remembering the taste of salt...
