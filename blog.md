## A cute small trip to London in summer
London! Fascinating name! Amazing place! In need of lot of exclamation marks to express my excitement and the beauty of this place!!! I will try to remember and write important details of my trip so that the reader could find it helpful. After coming back from London, I am so happy and full of energy that I forgot the painful planning process. Like every other trip , this needed planning and we had a very solid eight days plan made about a month ago. This is not enough. The bottle neck is the UK Visa. It is very likely to have a bad experience. The entire process is frustrating. It is like a black hole, just send your documents and wait for it to know about the decision. There is no online tracking system for it. Even their paid email and call service does not provide any useful information. For about 10$, you will just get a standard email response. You could just wait for it. I tracked my passport via UPS mail about every minute. So, I got my visa after fifteen working days. This spoiled my plan and reduced to four days trip. Four days!!! It is enough to explore London. With all new enthusiasm, I booked the same day flight ticket and was off for the dream place. Not caring about money and ignoring teh jet lag, I just wanted to explore the place to the fullest. 

The tickets to Gatwik airport is cheaper than Heathrow airport. I reached Gatwik at around 3 pm. Underground railway, thames link etc.. are the best means of transport. So, getting the Oyster card should always be the first thing to do. It allows you to go from anywhere to anywhere in london 1-6 zones. It is cheaper than (relatively) the one way ticket or day ticket. You can also get the cureency exchanged at the airport but you can always find better rates in the city. My journey started from LAX airport, so few details may or may not be helpful. I had to encounter eight hours of jet lag. Airbnb may seem cheaper but with good website hunt you could find a reasonable deal in even a 4-star hotel like Sheraton. I had a good dinner and sleep to prepare myself for tomorrow.

One major underground station's name which you would like to remeber is Paddington. All other stations are easily accessible from here. We left in the morning around 10 am. The following map is very useful for a one day amazing site-seeing in London. This roundabout will cover the famous places which everyone recommends. It is not a good idea to take the Big bus or hop on hop off bus for the tour as it will be costly and will give you only half od the london experience. Try to take underground trains to hop on and hop off at different destination. Sometime you know you have heard of a famous place and you build an imag eof it in your mind but when you are actually at that place you may not even be able to recognize. This happened to me at one of the places, so I am going to include photos as I discuss about it. 




## A System for Detecting Software Similarity: MOSS
Moss (for a Measure Of Software Similarity) is an automatic system for determining the similarity of programs.
Steps to run MOSS on Linux:

To obtain a Moss account, send a mail message to moss@moss.stanford.edu. The body of the message should appear exactly as follows:
registeruser 
mail username@domain

You will then get a reply containing the script that you will need to save as “moss.pl”. Just make sure that your system has the “perl” folder within the “/usr/bin/“ folder or change the path of the perl folder on the very first line of the script to be compatible to your machine.

Now set the execute permission using the command “chmod ug+x moss.pl”. This should allow you to send your queries to the Stanford server. 

Now submit the query to the server using the command similar to the following "./moss.pl -l cc -c "Run moss lab3b" -d TestMoss/&#42;/&#42;.cpp". Here -l is used to set the language which is C++ in the above case, -c is for the caption (optional) and -d is used to specify the directory. Note that &#42; is used to consider all such files. In the above example, within the TestMoss folder consider all folders and within them look for all .cpp files.

The result on submitting a query such as above would be:
Checking files . . .<br />
OK <br />

Query submitted.  Waiting for the server's response. <br />

## Big Ideas Finalist
Our team has been selected as a finalist in the 2018-2019 <a href="https://bigideas.berkeley.edu/">Big Ideas Contest</a> organized by UC Berkley in the Connected Communities category. We are among the 50 teams selected for the final round of this yearlong innovation contest. We have prototyped the technology and tested it for one specific use case. We are excited to work under the Big Ideas mentorship to map out the business model and logistical requirements.


## Santa Monica Pier
This is my favorite place in California. I love the enthusiasm and briskness around here. I have been there four times and still, it is not enough. It's not about the beaches (I mean come on, I am from the campus which has its own beach). Every time this place has some surprise planted for me. From an excellent musical show to incredible magic play and from city contour during sunrise to sun dropping in the sea, this place is a stretch of beauty. I saw a sea lion on my recent visit!
